## Process & Credits

This is an imitation build following a One Day build video a this link:
https://youtu.be/qFGzT73bjQ8

I have also reviewed the original developers source code for the project here:
https://github.com/KalleHallden/Netflix_Clone  

The objective was to develop some exposure to the exciting new Flutter framework whilst practicing my processes along the way

## Instructions

1. git clone https://github.com/ocripps24/netflix-clone
2. cd netflix-clone/netflix_clone
3. open -a simulator.app (XCode must be installed on your computer to run the XCode simulator although a similar Android system can be used)
4. flutter run (You must point to your local flutter installation to use flutter commands (See below))

## Installing Flutter and terminal commands

1. Download the latest flutter package from: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. Optional - follow the recommended steps here to setup your editor
3. Add 'export PATH=[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin:$PATH' to your ~/.bashrc file


Below is the default readme for a new Flutter project.
