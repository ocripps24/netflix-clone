## Process & Credits

The objective was to build the front end/UI side of the first page of the Netflix app. This is an imitation build following a One Day build video a this link:

I have also reviewed the original developers source code for the project here:

The objective was to develop some exposure to the exciting new Flutter framework whilst practicing my processes along the way.
